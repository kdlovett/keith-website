Hello there,

I'm Keith Lovett and this here is my website.

It's got some stuff on it, some of it serious, some of it a bit more facetious, all of it ```fairly groundbreaking```. Real talk.

I suppose the best place to start is the [about page](https://kdlovett.github.io/keiths-site/about/), so that you can get a sense of who I am and what I might do here.
