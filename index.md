Hello there!

This is going to (hopefully) serve as a place in virtual space where I can declutter my brain a bit. I apologize in advance if it doesn't seem like the most organized website around; I'm a kind of messy thinker.

In any case, maybe you will enjoy perusing some of the ideas or information here, so, have at it!

I suppose the best place to start is the [about page](https://kdlovett.github.io/keiths-site/about/), so that you can get a better picture of what I may (emphasis on may) be talking about here.
