Hello there!

This is going to (hopefully) serve as a place in virtual space where I can declutter my brain a bit.

For that reason I apologize in advance if it doesn't seem like the most organized website around; for some reason it took me the first twenty years of my life to realize that I am not really an organized person in general.

In any case, maybe you will enjoy perusing some of the ideas or information here, so, have at it!

I suppose the best place to start is the about page, so that you can get a better picture of what I may (emphasis on may) be talking about here.
