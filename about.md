Hello chums!

I'm a computer science student from the Boston area currently at Boston University.

I like the Sonic the Hedgehog Marble Zone theme. (Please, open it in another tab and rock out to it. I'll wait.)

Here you may find:

* Some stuff I do.
* Some stuff I do with friends.
* Some stuff I write.
* Some comedy stuff.
* Some stuff about computer science or math.
* Some stuff!!!
