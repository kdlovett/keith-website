Hello, I'm Keith.

Here you may find:

* Some stuff I do.
* Some stuff about computer science or math.
* Some stuff I write.
* Some stuff!

I study computer science at Boston University. Within the field, there are three things which interest me most: data-driven decision making and its effects on environments, systems, and software as a creative medium.

# About this Site

I made this site using gh-pages and [Jekyll](https://kdlovett.github.io/keiths-site/computer-science/2017/01/15/using_jekyll.html).
