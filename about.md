Hello chums!

I'm a computer science student from the Boston area currently at Boston University.

I like the Sonic the Hedgehog Marble Zone theme. (Please, open it in another tab and dance. I'll wait.)

Here you may find:

* Some stuff I do.
* Some stuff I want to learn about.
* Some stuff about computer science or math.
* Some stuff I write.
* Some stuff!!!

# About this Site

I made this site using gh-pages and [Jekyll](https://kdlovett.github.io/keiths-site/computer-science/2017/01/15/using_jekyll.html).
