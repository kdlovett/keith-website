Here's a project I worked on a bit over my Spring break - a map of the urban farms in and around Boston. I got a little bit more familiar with some cool stuff while working on this; Javascript, the Google Maps API, and some of the data available from a website called Socrata. What a cool site! Plenty of documentation, and a lot of good resources on how to go about putting some ideas into action.

The other thing I'm working on a little bit is making little test code that could still be a bit pragmatic. I sometimes try to wait for bigger ideas or something but smaller ones are probably no less important. Anyways, here's the result.


Here's the resources I used:

* [The Google Map API Javascript Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)

* [Here](https://dev.socrata.com/blog/2014/05/31/google-maps.html) is a blog post by a Socrata employee that was very helpful. Thanks!

* [Here](https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Urban-Farms/byxy-288e) is the data that I used.
