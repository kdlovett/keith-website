My databases professor gave an interesting anecdote about ATMs and how over 90% of the world's ATMs currently run on Windows XP. His claim was that this is unnecessary for something as relatively straight-forward as an ATM. The user is able to two primary tasks: add funds to their account, or remove funds from their account.

He claims that the operating system, in its unnecessary complexity, opens up a whole host of security vulnerabilities. And too, I'm sure, it's unnecessarily expensive.

I just think this raises an interesting and noteworthy point; a system that is any more complex than it needs to be, is not as efficient as a more simple system. This still applies even if the complexity is "under the covers," that is, if the average user's experience is relatively streamlined compared to what the system could possibly do.
