#### Clarify the Human/Data Relationship (Clarify HDR) is a series of articles meant to further explore the relationship between humans and data. To do so, a number of questions will be raised. What is the purpose of data? What roles does data play in the modern world? Might there be ways we can improve our relationship with data? Read on for some thoughts on the matter by a recent CS grad, Keith Lovett.

I sometimes like being facetious. It helps me reason. It helps me wrap around the facts and the figures and in the end perhaps come up with something meaningful. It helps me explore.

Here, we are exploring data. First, I want to know what purpose data serves... or perhaps more accurately, what purpose we (humans) have assigned to it.

Alright, it's time to be facetious. Why is the latter part of that sentence more accurate than the first?

Consider the word "cat", the word "dog", and the word "mouse." Each do not have an inherent purpose. They are simply words.

Let's cluster these three words together. "Cat", "dog", "mouse"... A set of words. A dataset.

Perhaps this is the purpose, not inherent in data, but that we have assigned *to* data. To be a collection, chunk, set, or whole. Why would we assign data this purpose?

Generally, it seems that humans assign purpose to things because we deem doing so somehow advantageous. There must be some advantage, then, to viewing data as a sort of collection.

Let's talk about words again. We collect words in a dictionary. Once more, *why?* Why do we do this?

Words help us to describe our world. Some might say this is their primary function. Other functions might include allowing us to connect more deeply with one another, or allowing us to collaborate on tasks. The more words we collect in our dictionary (and the more we practice using certain words), the more varied and precise words' functionality can be.

Computers execute functions! Functions are based on input data. Data can be words.

And so, it seems there are some interlinked relationships here, between data, computers, functionality, purpose, and - the one that I think gets a bit lost in the mix these days - humanity. These are the types of relationships I hope to explore here, particularly the first and the last - data and humanity. What are the tools in our toolkit for working with data? Can we design new ones? How? What do they look like?

I'm excited to ponder these questions, and to open up opportunities for discussion with anyone interested! Let's together clarify the relationship between humans and data.
