I sometimes like being facetious. It helps me reason. It helps me wrap around the facts and the figures and in the end come up with something meaningful, if not to others, then just to me.

I say this to inform you, my reader, that I am going to be facetious about the topic of data. First, I want to know what purpose it serves... or perhaps more accurately, what purpose we (humans) have assigned to it.

Let's get facetious. Why is the the latter part of that sentence more accurate than the first?

Data does not have an inherent purpose. The word "cat", the word "dog", and the word "mouse" - each do not have an inherent purpose. They are simply words.

Let's cluster these three words together. "Cat", "dog", "mouse"... A set of words. A dataset.

This is the purpose, not inherent in data, but that we have assigned to data. To be a collection, chunk, set, or whole. Why?

Because it would be advantageous to view data data in this way. Because it would be advantageous to have words listed in a dictionary. Because words serve a function - they help us describe our world.

But in fact, words serve many functions. In addition to helping us describe our world, they also allow us to connect more deeply with one another, collaborate on tasks, and countless other functions.

Computers execute functions. Functions are based on input data. Data can be words.

I think if there's something I hope I clarified, for myself and for my readers, through this short intro, it's that we should perhaps think more, and more deeply, about the relationship between humanity and data, because without humanity, data is one bland spreadsheet.
