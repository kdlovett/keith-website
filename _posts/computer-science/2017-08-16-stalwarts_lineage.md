Hello.

I'd like to mention the reincarnation of an old computer game I was working on in high school called Stalwart's Lineage. It never was fully completed, but just recently my buddy Addison suggested I work on it again.

*** [This is what I came up with.](https://github.com/kdlovett/stalwarts-lineage)

Update: Addison made some absolutely incredible music for the game and has also contributed some programming help. MAD PROPS YO. Awesome to create this alongside him.

I tried to get it embedded on the site here but I think due to the number of sprites and variables in the game, it doesn't want to run too well. As in, it just freezes, even if I don't change anything besides the necessary stuff when I put it on the site. Oh well! Time is better spent not trying to figure that one out.
