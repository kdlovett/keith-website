*Part 6 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

This weekend I took a bus down the North Island to Wellington. If you were to trace my route in and around the city over the three days it might resemble the output of Silly Spray, which marks successful exploration in my eyes: frantic and uncoordinated.

Wellington is probably one of the most self-aware cities I've ever visited. Works of Maori and Pakeha art essentially form a lot of the city, and quotes from writers are etched into its walkways.

One from Lauris Edmond reads "It's true you can't live here by chance, you have to do and be, not simbly watch or even describe. This is the city of action, the world headquarters of the verb."

Well, I certainly wouldn't call it as busy and bustling as New York, but it has hints of that ethos. No, Wellington to me blends this corporate hustle with strides for a gentle political virtue and distinctly-Kiwi-laid-backness. (Come to think of it I saw folks doing yoga, meditation, tai chi, and parkour in my three days there.)

In any case, all of this culminates to form a small but spectacular city where I was able to tour the Wellington and New Zealand Museums as well as Parliament, and explore the Lantern Festival for this Chinese New Year's celebration.

I was also able to explore Mount Victoria, whose peak overlooks the city, and hike downwards to Oriental Bay, where fireworks were set off Saturday evening.
