*Part 1 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

Hello,

I just arrived today in Auckland after a long flight from Boston (+some hours layover in SF). I haven't had much time to process anything because I've spent much of today zip-zooming here and there getting oriented, meeting my fellow study-abroaders, trying to buy essentials, etc.
But that's okay, I didn't mean to do much reflection here, that will come later. Here I just wanted set the stage so to speak for what's to come (roughly) during my time journaling.

## What am I doing in Auckland?

In terms of academics, I'll be taking courses at University of Auckland and also participating in an internship, during Auckland Uni's Summer Semester II into their Fall semester. During Summer Semester II, I'm taking a course about maps. Cartography, GPS, that sort of thing. I have my first lecture tomorrow. I'll also be taking a mandatory course about New Zealand's history and culture, and more generally, how to delve into and experience different cultures in a respectful way. During Fall Semester, I'm taking a computer science course about databases, and participating in an internship with a research group whom I will help translate programs they currently use, into cheaper and more flexible programs written in different programming languages.
Beyond that I don't necessarily know what I'll do with the rest of my time here -- a lot of hiking I'm sure. Swimming? Maybe try my hand at surfing? Bungee jumping? But all these maybes bring me to the next part...

## How will this journal "go"?

I don't think I'll be too... journalistic about this journal. That is to say, I'm going to avoid listing what I've done or plan to do. Instead I plan on just  jotting down a probably seemingly minute detail, once every other week. But it won't be minute in actuality, or, hopefully not, that is. Rather, I'll try to make it something I found particularly interesting, or something that seemed to encapsulate something important. Stories are more interesting when they leave you with more questions than you had when you first started reading, after all...

Until next time.
