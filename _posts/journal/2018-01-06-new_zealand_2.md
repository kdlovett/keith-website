*Part 2 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

There is a steep incline leading from where I'm staying to the university itself. This is not uncommon, it seems; volcanoes dot the islands, so, much of the landscape is dominated by hills.

I learned today that a fortified British colony used to exist where the university stands now, and that its location at the top of a hill was strategic in terms of its defense. In fact, the stone walls of the colony run through the campus, now largely covered in moss. The campus itself is home to a lot of different species of flowers and trees, all of which are meticulously labeled, and which attract birds whose songs are new to me.

I'm still quite a bit shaky on the history, but the Maori, the indigenous people here, formed the Treaty of Waitangi with the British in 1840. The treaty, written and translated in the heat of the moment, continues to spark debate today with regards to its validity in providing true Maori sovereignty.

Their language is frequently a part of city's signage, and their traditional art and designs can be found throughout. Its not uncommon to hear Kiwis use Maori phrases such as "kia ora," a standard greeting.
