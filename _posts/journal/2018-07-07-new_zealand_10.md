*Part 10 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

There's a lot that happened between now and my last entry - for one, after another long flight, I'm back in Boston! It's been great getting to catch up with family and friends and just generally experiencing things that come with arriving home after some time.

Since my last entry, the major things that came up were, trips to Rotorua, Lake Taupo, Great Barrier Island, Spirit's Bay, and Te Paki Sand Dunes.

I think it's best for me to just condense each of these into as few words as possible and post some of my better pictures for each.

In Rotorua I visited the Buried Village (remnants of a village once overtaken by a nearby volcano, now largely reclaimed by nature), went white water rafting, and went mountain biking in the Whakarewarewa Forest, home of many Californian Redwood trees.

In Lake Taupo I spent a lot of time staring out at the beautiful lake and visited Huka Falls.

In Great Barrier Island I went on a weekend hiking treck. We stayed in Mount Heale Hut and Kaiaraara Hut, lost the trail and followed a river, ran out of water and drank from streams, and ate a lot of trail mix and tuna. This was probably one of my favorite weekends in New Zealand.

In Spirit's Bay we stared in awe at the ocean and converging sea currents at the northernmost point of the continent. We arrived as the sun was setting on a rather rainy day, and needless to say, this was an incredible experience. We were more or less alone there.

In Te Paki Sand Dunes, we rented boogie boards and went flying down the now slick sand. I repurposed a muffin container and some dental floss and made a mask for myself to keep the sand from getting in my face.

An incredible trip. Lots of good people, good adventures, good laughs, etc. Good.
