I'm going to occassionally use this as a space to put interesting or useful German words. Update: Okay, sheesh! This was a pain to get up and running. Anyways, yeah, just as a note to self: just put the date the word was added by the word, instead of changing the whole date of the blog post. That would be unnecessarily annoying.
