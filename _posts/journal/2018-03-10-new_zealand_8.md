*Part 8 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

The fall semester has begun and I've settled into a schedule I think. My course on databases usually occurs in the evenings, so that gives me time beforehand to spend in one of the labs on campus, where I help with the research of my supervisors. They work for the university at the Liggin's Institute, a hub for cross-disciplinary research pertaining to early-life health and its effects down the road.

I've started swimming most nights, which has been a nice way to decompress, and I usually try to play some pick-up basketball on the weekends at Victoria Park. Occassionally I'll squeeze in something extra like a club meeting or a walk somewhere, but for the most part, my schedule for the week is booked pretty tightly.

There's a very nice kind of quiet here. One does not need to try so hard to listen.
