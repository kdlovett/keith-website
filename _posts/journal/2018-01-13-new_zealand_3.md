*Part 3 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

The traditional creation myth, according to Maori storytelling, involves Ranginui (The Sky Father) and Papatuanuku (The Earth Mother), who were at first locked together in a lover's embrace. They gave birth to around seventy gods, including Tane Mahuta (God of the Forest), who, in an attempt to bring light to the world and give space for him and his siblings to grow, lied on his back against his mother and pushed his hands and feet into his father, thereby seperating Earth and Sky and enlightening his siblings.

I find this quite poetic and I think it also seeks to explain the tumultuous Earth formations throughout New Zealand.

The other day I was walking through the city and saw a woman who looked perhaps thirty, and her daughter, maybe five or six. The mom was busy tuning her guitar, and the daughter was simultaneously unrolling a mat that concealed rugs for sale, doing something on her Ipad, and gleefully saying something to her mom in Portuguese I think... I think she was giving her mom instructions. Anyways, they had a little chair with a homemade billboard attached to it: "Mom and daughter travel the world."

I'm sorry I'm occassionally letting your questions slip. As much as it is me being busy, not just "having fun" but also learning to adjust and taking classes, it's also a matter of choosing what details I'd like to share, and which ones I'd like to keep here with me.

I hope you understand.
