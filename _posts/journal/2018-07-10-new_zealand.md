*Part 1 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

Hello,

I just arrived today in Auckland after a long flight from Boston (+some hours layover in SF). I haven't had much time to process anything because I've spent much of today zip-zooming here and there getting oriented, meeting my fellow study-abroaders, trying to buy essentials, etc.
But that's okay, I didn't mean to do much reflection here, that will come later. Here I just wanted set the stage so to speak for what's to come (roughly) during my time journaling.

![NZBay](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZBay.jpg)

## What am I doing in Auckland?

In terms of academics, I'll be taking courses at University of Auckland and also participating in an internship, during Auckland Uni's Summer Semester II into their Fall semester. During Summer Semester II, I'm taking a course about maps. Cartography, GPS, that sort of thing. I have my first lecture tomorrow. I'll also be taking a mandatory course about New Zealand's history and culture, and more generally, how to delve into and experience different cultures in a respectful way. During Fall Semester, I'm taking a computer science course about databases, and participating in an internship with a research group whom I will help translate programs they currently use, into cheaper and more flexible programs written in different programming languages.
Beyond that I don't necessarily know what I'll do with the rest of my time here -- a lot of hiking I'm sure. Swimming? Maybe try my hand at surfing? Bungee jumping? But all these maybes bring me to the next part...

## How will this journal "go"?

I don't think I'll be too... journalistic about this journal. That is to say, I'm going to avoid listing what I've done or plan to do. Instead I plan on just  jotting down a probably seemingly minute detail, once every other week. But it won't be minute in actuality, or, hopefully not, that is. Rather, I'll try to make it something I found particularly interesting, or something that seemed to encapsulate something important. Stories are more interesting when they leave you with more questions than you had when you first started reading, after all...

Until next time.

*Part 2 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

There is a steep incline leading from where I'm staying to the university itself. This is not uncommon, it seems; volcanoes dot the islands, so, much of the landscape is dominated by hills.

![NZLandscape](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZLandscape.jpg)

I learned today that a fortified British colony used to exist where the university stands now, and that its location at the top of a hill was strategic in terms of its defense. In fact, the stone walls of the colony run through the campus, now largely covered in moss. The campus itself is home to a lot of different species of flowers and trees, all of which are meticulously labeled, and which attract birds whose songs are new to me.

![NZCannon](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZCannon.jpg)

I'm still quite a bit shaky on the history, but the Maori, the indigenous people here, formed the Treaty of Waitangi with the British in 1840. The treaty, written and translated in the heat of the moment, continues to prompt discussion concerning society and politics today.

![NZLandscape](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZMaoriPortrait.jpg)

Their language is frequently a part of city's signage, and their traditional art and designs can be found throughout. Its not uncommon to hear Kiwis use Maori phrases such as "kia ora," a standard greeting.

*Part 3 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

The traditional creation myth, according to Maori storytelling, involves Ranginui (The Sky Father) and Papatuanuku (The Earth Mother), who were at first locked together in a lover's embrace. They gave birth to around seventy gods, including Tane Mahuta (God of the Forest), who, in an attempt to bring light to the world and give space for him and his siblings to grow, lied on his back against his mother and pushed his hands and feet into his father, thereby seperating Earth and Sky and enlightening his siblings. (1)

I find this quite poetic and I think it also seeks to explain the tumultuous Earth formations throughout New Zealand.

![NZCliff](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZCliff.jpg)

The other day I was walking through the city and saw a woman who looked perhaps thirty, and her daughter, maybe five or six. The mom was busy tuning her guitar, and the daughter was simultaneously unrolling a mat that concealed rugs for sale, doing something on her Ipad, and gleefully saying something to her mom in Portuguese I think... I think she was giving her mom instructions. Anyways, they had a little chair with a homemade billboard attached to it: "Mom and daughter travel the world."

![NZStatue](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZStatue.jpg)

I'm sorry I'm occassionally letting your questions slip. As much as it is me being busy, not just "having fun" but also learning to adjust and taking classes, it's also a matter of choosing what details I'd like to share, and which ones I'd like to keep here with me.

I hope you understand.

![NZClocktower](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZClocktower.jpg)

(1) I believe many variants of this story exist in the surrounding islands. This was the one I learned in class.

*Part 4 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

I came across this [quite nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgU-RWQ4J7o) while working on a project for class. The marketing by the headphone company doesn't seem to impede on the ideas.

Today I travelled to Wenderholm, about an hour and a half outside the city, and along the Puhoi River.

![NZKayak](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZKayak.jpg)

The husband and wife who run the kayak hire (rental) service were hospitable, informing me of the layout of the small and secluded Puhoi Village, and driving me back to the bus stop for my return trip.

![NZPuhoi](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZPuhoi.jpg)

I might compare elements of Puhoi Village to some found in New Hampshire; a general store with wooden floorboards and handwritten signs advertising goods, some portion of a rowdy populace keen on frequenting the pub, grumbling vintage cars and motorcycles...

![NZLookout](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZLookout.jpg)

Occassionally in circumstances such as these where I'm no longer in Auckland CBD (Central Business District) or on campus (where admittedly I've hardly said a word thus far, though in my defense it's very quiet, since it's still summer) I'm reminded that I'm a bit of an anomaly, and it's a bit odd, to witness my accent give people pause, then eventually they might ask me where I'm from, and we'll share a few words. (Imagine, how this feeling must be amplified, when travelling somewhere with several more cultural barriers!)

![NZWaiwera](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWaiwera.jpg)

For this reason I'm looking forward to slowly etching out a little home here. Finding a good meal somewhere, upholding some responsibility, finding a new person to be friends with, these are the types of things that help immensely.

*Part 5 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

Last weekend I visited Waitangi, to learn more about Maori traditions.

![NZWaitangi](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWaitangi.jpg)

I then took a ferry in the Bay of Islands to the cozy town of Russell.

![NZSunset](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZSunset.jpg)

Once considered a "hell hole" by missionaries who were appalled by the behavior of the whalers and plunderers who resided there, the town now embraces the title with irony: this is now the type of town where kids skip down the roads as the sun goes down, passing tiny cottages with flowerbeds in the windowsills.

![NZRussell](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZRussell.jpg)

And indeed the sun did go down, and the stars that presided over the sky without the light polution I'm now accustomed to were nice. Long Beach offered a particularly calming view, and the water there was almost eerily quiet, I think perhaps in part due to the recent supermoon.

Today is Waitangi Day and I noticed last night a crowd gathering at Silo Park, overlooking the bridge leading into Auckland. "There's a lightshow starting on the bridge in a few minutes," someone told me, so I stood with them on the pier there. As the bridge dimmed before the show I could hear an occassional drum beat or horn echoing from various locations along the harbor.

![NZSkytower](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZSkytower.jpg)

I'm not quite sure what this was, but I know the bridge has in the past been traversed by peaceful protestors demanding tino rangatiratanga, Maori self-sovereignty.

*Part 6 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

This weekend I took a bus down the North Island to Wellington. If you were to trace my route in and around the city over the three days it might resemble the output of Silly Spray, which marks successful exploration in my eyes: frantic and uncoordinated.

![NZEveningBay](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZEveningBay.jpg)

Wellington is probably one of the most self-aware cities I've ever visited. Works of Maori and Pakeha art essentially form a lot of the city, and quotes from writers are etched into its walkways.

![NZWakas](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWakas.jpg)

One from Lauris Edmond reads "It's true you can't live here by chance, you have to do and be, not simply watch or even describe. This is the city of action, the world headquarters of the verb."

![NZLights](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZLights.png)

Well, I certainly wouldn't call it as busy and bustling as New York, but it has hints of that ethos. No, Wellington to me blends this corporate hustle with strides for a gentle political virtue and distinctly-Kiwi-laid-backness. (Come to think of it I saw folks doing yoga, meditation, tai chi, and parkour in my three days there.)

![NZLantern](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZLantern.jpg)

In any case, all of this culminates to form a small but spectacular city where I was able to tour the Wellington and New Zealand Museums as well as Parliament, and explore the Lantern Festival for this Chinese New Year's celebration.

![NZParliament](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZParliament.jpg)

I was also able to explore Mount Victoria, whose peak overlooks the city, and hike downwards to Oriental Bay, where fireworks were set off Saturday evening.

![NZVictoria](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZVictoria.jpg)

*Part 7 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

The island of Waiheke is a half hour ferry ride out of Auckland.

![NZWaihekeFerry](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWaihekeFerry.jpg)

I wanted to get one last stop in before my fall semester here starts, and so I planned to camp on the island at least a night.

![NZWaiheke](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWaiheke.jpg)

I decided it didn't really matter that I didn't have any equipment, so long as conditions were right. My readers might be asking, "But Keith, what about an air mattress, or a sleeping bag?" To which I would respond that with the number of clothes I was adorning before settling down for the night, I had become the air mattress. I had become the sleeping bag.

![NZWaihekeRoad](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWaihekeRoad.jpg)

When I arrived at the grounds I couldn't find the ranger at first, so some travelers about my age kindly mentioned that I could stop by their site to get my bearings. They were speaking German to one another, so I took the opportunity to practice a bit and talked to one of them. He mentioned a beach nearby I could visit, though I didn't get the chance to see it. We were, after all, in a large area; Whakanawha Regional Park. As I settled down for the night I was looking directly up at the Milky Way. First time I've seen it, I think.

![NZWaihekeBeach](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZWaihekeBeach.jpg)

The night is always, always there, even if the sun or city lights have thrown themselves in front of it. It patiently waits for our rediscovery of it. This seems organic, natural, even expected. (We are, after all, star stuff.) What perplexes me though is that, at least in one way or another, one has to be lucky to catch on to this at a moment's notice, despite it being so foundational. Something needs to trigger the epiphany... ("Oh, it's you again, Night. Hello.") Some of the best people you'll meet seem to hold the allure of the sky close to them, fold it up and tuck it somewhere safe, like under their pillow or something.

*Part 8 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

The fall semester has begun and I've settled into a schedule I think. My course on databases usually occurs in the evenings, so that gives me time beforehand to spend in one of the labs on campus, where I help with the research of my supervisors. They work for the university at the Liggins Institute, a hub for cross-disciplinary research pertaining to early-life health and its effects down the road.

![NZShips](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZShips.jpg)

I've started swimming most nights, which has been a nice way to decompress, and I usually try to play some pick-up basketball on the weekends at Victoria Park. Occassionally I'll squeeze in something extra like a club meeting or a walk somewhere, but for the most part, my schedule for the week is booked pretty tightly.

![NZLanterns](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZLanterns.jpg)

There's a very nice kind of quiet here. One does not need to try so hard to listen.

*Part 9 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

It's mid-semester break so I've been able to go on some trips recently. First I took a ferry to the recently formed island of Rangitoto. The small island is largely untouched except for small cabins called "Bachs" that dot the coast.

Unfortunately I was getting over a cold at this point and didn't want to push my limits, so I did not hike to the peak; instead I meandered through some of the trails among igneous rock and groves of trees further up the coast.

![NZPath](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZPath.jpg)

The groves were beautiful but at the same time eerie in their stillness. The only sound was from the distant waves and occassional rustle of leaves. I later learned that the lack of a food source kept birds from inhabiting the island in large numbers, so, no birdsong.

![NZRangitoto](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZRangitoto.jpg)

The next day I was feeling a little better and felt comfortable hiking Mount Victoria in the nearby town of Devonport.

![NZDevonport](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZDevonport.jpg)

From it you get a view of the entirety of Rangitoto.

![NZMtVicView](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZMtVicView.jpg)

The day after that I was feeling back to normal so I took another ferry to Gulf Harbour and explored the forests and farmland overlooking Te Haruhi Bay.

![NZShakespeare](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZShakespeare.jpg)

Next I joined four other of my fellow travellers and we made our way to Tairua, a small town in the Coromandel Peninsula to camp for a few nights and explore.

![NZTairua](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZTairua.jpg)

The first day we drove to Hahei Village and visited Cathedral Cove, where crashing waves have molded impressive sand sculptures. A single thought conjured in my head more distinctly with each wave...

![NZCove](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZCove.jpg)

... I feel like an ant. The walk to and from the coves was equally incredible.

![NZHike](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZHike.jpg)

The next day we hiked through the Broken Hills, up one of many steep peeks, back down, and through...

![NZBrokenHills](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZBrokenHills.jpg)

... A shortcut offered by the mines below, pitch black save our the cones of light from our flashlights and the faint blue luminescence of groups of miniscule worms clinging to the mine's dripping ceilings. A few boarded off areas marked "DO NOT ENTER" had hatches to view probably the most unnerving drops into nothingness I've seen. Thinking about it is giving me pause.

The next day we drove through the mountains, visiting the Coromandel (town) and stopping along the way to talk with a farmer, and to view a grove of Kauri trees, some of the largest in the world, which live thousands of years.

![NZKauri](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZKauri.jpg)

After returning the weather was starting to worsen. This actually made for good conditions to visit Hot Water Beach, which gets its name from the geothermal activity beneath it. Borrowing some shovels from the owner of our campsite back in Tairua (who I should add was very gracious and easy-going), we joined the thirty-or-so other evening beach-goers in forming a trench of sorts down into the hot sand, and away from the cold ocean and worsening rain.

![NZPurple](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZPurple.jpg)

When we returned we spent some time resting in the campsite's lounge with some of the other campers. It's good to be travelling with such reliable and positive people. The weather that has been hitting New Zealand the last few days has been unusually harsh, and one might think that might put a damper on things, particularly camping. But it was hardly an issue, and I'm looking forward to discovering more with folks in the next few months here.

![NZTreee](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZTree.jpg)

*Part 10 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

There's a lot that happened between now and my last entry - for one, after another long flight, I'm back in Boston! It's been great getting to catch up with family and friends and just generally experiencing things that come with arriving home after some time.

![NZSign](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZSign.jpg)

Since my last entry, the major things that came up were, trips to Rotorua, Lake Taupo, Great Barrier Island, Spirit's Bay, and Te Paki Sand Dunes.

I think it's best for me to just condense each of these into as few words as possible and post some of my better pictures for each.

In Rotorua I visited the Buried Village (remnants of a village once overtaken by a nearby volcano, now largely reclaimed by nature), went white water rafting, and went mountain biking in the Whakarewarewa Forest, home of many Californian Redwood trees.

![NZBuriedMountains](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZBuriedMountains.jpg)

![NZBuriedRiver](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZBuriedRiver.jpg)

![NZRotBird](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZRotBird.jpg)

![NZRotBird](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZRotHot.jpg)

![NZRotFor](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZRotFor.jpg)

In Lake Taupo I spent a lot of time staring out at the beautiful lake and visited Huka Falls.

![NZTaupo](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZTaupo.jpg)

![NZTaupoBird](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZTaupoBird.jpg)

![NZTaupoRiv](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZTaupoRiv.jpg)

![NZHukaFalls](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZHukaFalls.jpg)

In Great Barrier Island I went on a weekend hiking treck. We stayed in Mount Heale Hut and Kaiaraara Hut, lost the trail and followed a river, ran out of water and drank from streams, and ate a lot of trail mix and tuna. This was probably one of my favorite weekends in New Zealand.

![NZGBMountains](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZGBMountains.jpg)

![NZGBHut](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZGBHut.jpg)

![NZGBRiv](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZGBRiv.jpg)

In Spirit's Bay we stared in awe at the ocean and converging sea currents at the northernmost point of the continent. We arrived as the sun was setting on a rather rainy day, and needless to say, this was an incredible experience. We were more or less alone there.

![NZLighthouse](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZLighthouse.jpg)

![NZDunesDist](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZDunesDist.jpg)

In Te Paki Sand Dunes, we rented boogie boards and went flying down the now slick sand. I repurposed a muffin container and some dental floss and made a mask for myself to keep the sand from getting in my face.

![NZDunes](/keiths-site/image_dir/NZDunes.jpg)

An incredible trip. Lots of good people, good adventures, good laughs, etc. Good.
