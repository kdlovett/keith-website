*Part 9 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

It's mid-semester break so I've been able to go on some trips recently. First I took a ferry to the recently formed island of Rangitoto. The small island is largely untouched except for small cabins called "Bachs" that dot the coast.

Unfortunately I was getting over a cold at this point and didn't want to push my limits, so I did not hike to the peak; instead I meandered through some of the trails among igneous rock and groves of trees further up the coast.

The groves were beautiful but at the same time eerie in their stillness. The only sound was from the distant waves and occassional rustle of leaves. I later learned that the lack of a food source kept birds from inhabiting the island in large numbers, so, no birdsong.

The next day I was feeling a little better and felt comfortable hiking Mount Victoria in the nearby town of Devonport.

From it you get a view of the entirety of Rangitoto.

The day after that I was feeling back to normal so I took another ferry to Gulf Harbour and explored the forests and farmland overlooking Te Haruhi Bay.

Next I joined four other of my fellow travellers and we made our way to Tairua, a small town in the Coromandel Peninsula to camp for a few nights and explore.

The first day we drove to Hahei Village and visited Cathedral Cove, where crashing waves have molded impressive sand sculptures. A single thought conjured in my head more distinctly with each wave...

... I feel like an ant. The walk to and from the coves was equally incredible.

The next day we hiked through the Broken Hills, up one of many steep peeks, back down, and through...

... A shortcut offered by the mines below, pitch black save our the cones of light from our flashlights and the faint blue luminescence of groups of miniscule worms clinging to the mine's dripping ceilings. A few boarded off areas marked "DO NOT ENTER" had hatches to view probably the most unnerving drops into nothingness I've seen. Thinking about it is giving me pause.

The next day we drove through the mountains, visiting the Coromandel (town) and stopping along the way to talk with a farmer, and to view a grove of Kauri trees, some of the largest in the world, which live thousands of years.

After returning the weather was starting to worsen. This actually made for good conditions to visit Hot Water Beach, which gets its name from the geothermal activity beneath it. Borrowing some shovels from the owner of our campsite back in Tairua (who I should add was very gracious and easy-going), we joined the thirty-or-so other evening beach-goers in forming a trench of sorts down into the hot sand, and away from the cold ocean and worsening rain.

When we returned we spent some time resting in the campsite's lounge with some of the other campers. It's good to be travelling with such reliable and positive people. The weather that has been hitting New Zealand the last few days has been unusually harsh, and one might think that might put a damper on things, particularly camping. But it was hardly an issue, and I'm looking forward to discovering more with folks in the next few months here.
