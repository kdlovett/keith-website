*Part 5 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

Last weekend I visited Waitangi, to learn more about Maori traditions.

I then took a ferry in the Bay of Islands to the cozy town of Russell.

Once considered a "hell hole" by missionaries who were appalled by the behavior of the whalers and plunderers who resided there, the town now embraces the title with irony: this is now the type of town where kids skip down the roads as the sun goes down, passing tiny cottages with flowerbeds in the windowsills.

And indeed the sun did go down, and the stars that presided over the sky without the light polution I'm now accustomed to were nice. Long Beach offered a particularly calming view, and the water there was almost eerily quiet, I think perhaps in part due to the recent supermoon.

Today is Waitangi Day and I noticed last night a crowd gathering at Silo Park, overlooking the bridge leading into Auckland. "There's a lightshow starting on the bridge in a few minutes," someone told me, so I stood with them on the pier there. As the bridge dimmed before the show I could hear an occassional drum beat or horn echoing from various locations along the harbor.

I'm not quite sure what this was, but I know the bridge has in the past been traversed by peaceful protestors demanding tino rangatiratanga, Maori self-sovereignty.
