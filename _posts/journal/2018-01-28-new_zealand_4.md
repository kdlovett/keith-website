*Part 4 of a journal documenting shenanigans abroad in New Zealand for family and anyone else interested.*

I came across this [quite nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgU-RWQ4J7o) while working on a project for class. The marketing by the headphone company doesn't seem to impede on the ideas.

Today I travelled to Wenderholm, about an hour and a half outside the city, and along the Puhoi River.

The husband and wife who run the kayak hire (rental) service were hospitable, informing me of the layout of the small and secluded Puhoi Village, and driving me back to the bus stop for my return trip.

I might compare elements of Puhoi Village to some found in New Hampshire; a general store with wooden floorboards and handwritten signs advertising goods, some portion of a rowdy populace keen on frequenting the pub, grumbling vintage cars and motorcycles...

Occassionally in circumstances such as these where I'm no longer in Auckland CBD (Central Business District) or on campus (where admittedly I've hardly said a word thus far, though in my defense it's very quiet, since it's still summer) I'm reminded that I'm a bit of an anomaly, and it's a bit odd, to witness my accent give people pause, then eventually they might ask me where I'm from, and we'll share a few words. (Imagine, how this feeling must be amplified, when travelling somewhere with several more cultural barriers!)

For this reason I'm looking forward to slowly etching out a little home here. Finding a good meal somewhere, upholding some responsibility, finding a new person to be friends with, these are the types of things that help immensely.
